## **Pattern of N**
- You are given a number stored in a variable with the name ```N```
- You have to print all the numbers in the range from ```1 to N*N```
- For example, if the value stored in ```N = 3``` , then all the numbers in the range, from [1,9] need to be printed, such that there are 3 numbers on each line. Therefore, the required output is
####
    1 2 3
    4 5 6 
    7 8 9

#### **Input**
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in the variable ```N```

#### **Output**
Print all the numbers in the range from [1, N*N], as shown in the problem statement, such that there are ```N``` numbers on each line
