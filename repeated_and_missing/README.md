## **Repeated and Missing**
- Given an array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. In the given array, one number from set {1, 2, …n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. Find these two numbers.
- Print the missing one first and then the repeated one with a space character in between them.

#### **Input**
It contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000).
</br>
It contains n integers array (1 ≤ Ai ≤ n).

#### **Output**
print the answer.

#### **Sample Input 1**
    5
    1 2 3 3 4
#### **Sample Output 1**
    5 3 
#### **Sample Input 2**
    2
    1 1
#### **Sample Output 2**
    2 1

#### **Hint**
    For Sample Input 1 : 
    5
    1 2 3 3 4
    the number which is repeating in the above array is 3
    The general sequence without any repetition will be 1 2 3 4 5
    Looking at the sequence 1 2 3 4 5, we know that 5 is missing the given array
