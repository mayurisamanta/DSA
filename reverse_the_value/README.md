## **Reverse the Value**
- You are given a number stored in a variable with the name ```num```
- You have to reverse the number
- For example, the number stored in the variable ```num = 971``` , then the required output will be ```179```

####
    Note : The number does not contain any leading zeroes
    Converting the value into string is not valid

#### **Input**
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in the variable ```num```

#### **Output**
Reverse the number, and print it, as given in the problem statement

#### **Hint**
    In the sample test case, the value stored in num = 971,
    therefore, the required output becomes, 179
