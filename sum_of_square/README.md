## **Pattern of N**
- Given a non-negative integer ```k``` , decide whether there're two integers ```a``` and ```b``` such that ```a^2+ b^2= k```

#### **Input**
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in ```k```
#### **Output**
Print ```true``` if there exists a k which can satisfy the given equation ```a^2+ b^2= k```
#### **Sample Input 1**
    k = 25
#### **Sample Output 1**
    true
#### **Sample Input 2**
    k = 7
#### **Sample Output 2**
    false
#### **Hint**
    In the first sample test case, the value stored in k = 25
    for the values a = 1, b = 2 , the sum of square = a*a + b*b = 3*3 + 4*4 = 25, which is equal to k = 25
    Thus the output is true

    In the second sample test case, the value stored in k = 7
    there is no value of a and b exists, which will be equal to k = 7
    Thus the output is false
